# vcredistinstaller

This is an older version of the vcredistinstaller script that I was using for awhile to install VC++ Redists on systems I was setting up, it was originally used as part of an initialization script for Windows installs then adapted into a seperate script that I was scripting because I was bored and wanted to learn what I could do with batch scripts.

I am not going to provide the installation files, the Visual C++ Redistributable installation files must be in the same directory as the batch file and named as seen in the script.
