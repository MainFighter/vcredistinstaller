# Visual C++ Redistrubutable Download and Installer script

**The script will grab the files it needs from my server by default, it can easily be changed though.**

## Background

The script was originally made (legacy versions) as a simple installer script for automated Windows installs, I decided to make the script its own thing mainly because I wanted to see what could be done with batch scripts and because I was bored. I rewrote the script because I was interested in seeing what I could do and wanted to make a modular install script that I could use for multiple things.

## What does it do?

The script downloads and installs Visual C++ Redistributables automatically.

Just run the script, the script automatically asks for Administrator permissions and from there downloads and installs the VC++ Redists in the background.

## Customize

The script is pretty customizable through variables that are at the top of the script. All the variables are explained in the script.
